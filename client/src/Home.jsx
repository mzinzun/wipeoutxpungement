                    I would like to help anyone get their 2nd chance without breaking you to do so.  Most of us have done our time, building ourselves back up and might even still be struggling. I am your gal that has the experience, knowledge and willingness to help you.  I am not an attorney so attorney advice I can not give.  But I can give experience, opinion, and the individual help you need.
